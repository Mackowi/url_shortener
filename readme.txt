Hello,
this is the manual for running url shortener. List of needed dependencies:
Python, Flask, Shell, python-dotenv, Flask-SQLAlchemy.
After setting up virtual environment and installing dependencies, just type "flask run" to start it.
Go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the shortener.
You put url you want to shorten, and then optionally shortcode which present is becoming the final shorten url.
